        My name is Eshan Chakraborty and I am currently learning full-stack web development and focus on creating dynamic and beautiful web pages with a vibrant frontend and a scalable backend using MERN stack(Mongo Db, Express JS, React JS, Node JS). 
       <br/>
        Also I have been recently exploring the field of machine learning and deep learning . Building small yet useful machine learning models have been absolutely enjoyable. The ability of a computer to predict the results based on previous learnings is fascinating and am looking forward to explore more in this world of AI.
